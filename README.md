**S**tuff **I** **D**o **N**ot **K**now **Yet**

This is a list of stuff I don't know as of yet and that I think deserve to be eventually learned. Some will be things I've maybe worked with before but still think deserve the time to be properly learned. Others may be completely new and unexplored topics that caught my attention for some reason.

Every item should fit the following template:

  * **Name** - Short description
    * Links and tips:
      * Oficial docs - https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/
      * Collection of learning material - http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/
    * Optional Comment

Once learned, items might be moved to a different section with the steps took in order to help those who might want to also learn it.

Contributions with links and tips on how to learn anything on the list are very much welcome
